The objective of this project is to make a final MVP for our application using the most current Java-based **Spring Boot** development technology.

**Spring Boot** is a reinterpretation of Spring framework. It allows you to focus solely on the development process, eliminating complex manipulations to customize your application.

This project is a more modern and refined implementation of the projects [FWA](https://github.com/rbiodies/FWA) and [Cinema](https://github.com/rbiodies/Cinema).
